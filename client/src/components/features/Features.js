                    <p>Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has spread across the world and the World Health Organization (WHO) has characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic (WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020). People and outbound travelers are recommended to closely monitor the situation. Moreover, the public must fully cooperate and act as the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) recommends for your safety and for others, and to decrease negative social and economic impacts. The Disease Infected Zones were determined to include the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (including Special Administrative Regions Macau and Hong Kong), South Korea, Iran and Italy.</p>
